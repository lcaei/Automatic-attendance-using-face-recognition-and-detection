# Automatic-attendance-using-face-recognition-and-detection
Attendance in schools is very important and can influence the behavior of students if the value is preserved. When taken manually, it is tedious, boring and time consuming, lectures are interrupted, high human error probability, non-guarantee of the integrity, poor teaching quality and ineffective payment of teachers. To solve the above problems this proposed system will automate the process of taking attendance in real time, using a raspberry pi and a camera. This project uses dlib and opencv to perform face detection and Linear Binary Pattern to perform recognition. The studentâ€™s attendance is stored in an SQlite db in the raspberry and updated in a MySQL db. This project has nine modules including authentication, manage lecturers, manage courses, manage students, manage administrators, assigning of courses, assigning of access right, students/teachers attendance and start class. The system will automatically update students present attendance in the data base and a backup sql file uploaded in periods of one hour
